# REMNANTS — Lore Bible
### Version 1.1

## The Departure

Five hundred years from now, Earth is dying. Not in the dramatic way — no single asteroid, no sudden war — but in the slow, grinding way that civilizations actually end. Resource depletion, ecological collapse, political fracture. The governments that remain pool what's left into one final gamble: **Project Exodus**. Hundreds of colony ships, launched in every viable direction, carrying the sum of human knowledge and whatever humanity can spare.

The ships carry everyone. Scientists, farmers, engineers, families. But also — because the governments see an opportunity — the ships carry society's "undesirables." Criminals, political dissidents, the inconvenient, the unwanted. Some ships are designated colony vessels. Others are quietly designated as prison transports. The passengers don't always know which kind they're on.

**95% of the ships fail.** Lost to void, to mechanical failure, to the simple math of interstellar travel. Of the ones that survive, most land on worlds that kill their colonists within a generation.

One ship — a prison colony vessel — crash-lands on a world that is barely, grudgingly habitable.

---

## The Crash

The ship hits hard. Not a landing — a crash. Fifty percent of the colonists die on impact or in the hours that follow. The ship breaks apart across kilometers of alien terrain, scattering technology, supplies, and bodies across a landscape that has never seen anything from Earth.

The survivors emerge into a world that wants to kill them in ways they don't yet understand:

- **Heavy gravity** — roughly 1.3G. Everything is heavier. Running is harder. Falling hurts more. Over generations, this will reshape human bodies.
- **Thin atmosphere** — breathable, but just barely. Exertion is punishing. The air tastes wrong. Lungs burn for the first few years until adaptation begins.
- **Alien ecosystems** — nothing here evolved alongside humans. The biochemistry is different enough that almost nothing is edible without processing. Some things are actively toxic on contact.
- **Indigenous life** — ranging from simple organisms to something approaching sapience. None of it recognizes humans as anything other than a new variable in the ecosystem.

The survivors have no choice but to make it work.

---

## Three Generations Later

The people who call themselves **Remnants** are not the people who left Earth. Three generations of survival on an alien world have changed them — some through necessity, some through science, some through the planet itself.

### Physical Adaptation

The Remnants are visibly different from their Earth ancestors:

- **Denser bones** — an adaptation to heavy gravity. Remnants are shorter and stockier than baseline humans. Their skeletons can absorb impacts that would shatter Earth-normal bone.
- **Enhanced lung capacity** — larger chest cavities, more efficient oxygen absorption. A Remnant can function at exertion levels that would leave an Earth human gasping.
- **Thicker skin** — not dramatically, but measurably. Minor environmental toxins that would cause rashes or reactions in baseline humans are shrugged off.
- **Altered metabolism** — Remnants process food differently, extracting more from less. They can survive on the processed native organisms that would provide almost no nutrition to an Earth human.

These changes happened fast — too fast for natural selection alone. The colony ship carried genetic modification tools, and the first generation used them aggressively. Some modifications took cleanly. Others didn't. The third generation carries the accumulated results of both planned science and unplanned mutation.

### Social Fracture

The original colonists were a mix of prisoners (real criminals and political), guards, administrators, and whatever specialists the ship carried. Within a generation, those distinctions stopped mattering in the way Earth intended. New factions formed around survival philosophy:

- Some groups retained old Earth morality — cooperation, shared resources, collective decision-making. They tend to build settlements, practice medicine, and try to understand the world scientifically.
- Others embraced the brutality their ancestors were accused of — or were driven to it by necessity. Raiding, territorial aggression, might-makes-right governance. The planet doesn't reward gentleness.
- Most exist somewhere in between, doing what it takes to survive without losing all of what makes them human.

### The Houses

A **House** is the fundamental social unit of Remnant civilization. Part clan, part extended family, part survival cooperative. Houses range from a handful of blood relatives to larger groups bound by oath and mutual necessity.

Each House maintains its own:
- **Gene pool** — the accumulated genetic adaptations, planned modifications, and unplanned mutations of its members
- **Knowledge base** — what the House has learned about the planet, its creatures, its resources
- **Territory** — the area a House controls or claims, however tenuously
- **Culture** — traditions, values, and practices that have emerged over three generations

Houses are how Remnants survive. An individual alone on this planet doesn't last long. A House — with its shared knowledge, its collective resources, its generational memory — can endure.

---

## Nomenclature and Identity

### Character Designations

Remnant Houses use numerical designations for active field operatives: **Remnant-XXXX**, where XXXX is typically derived from deployment timestamps or sequential assignment. This impersonal system serves several functions:

**Psychological Distance:** On a world where death is common, emotional attachment to individuals can be paralyzing. Numerical designations help maintain operational focus. You grieve for "Remnant-7161" differently than you grieve for "Sarah" or "Marcus."

**Organizational Clarity:** Clear identification without the ambiguity of personal names that might be duplicated, mispronounced, or culturally loaded. In a House of mixed heritage (which most are, after three generations), numerical systems avoid cultural friction.

**Cultural Echo:** The original colonists were prisoners — already reduced to numbers in Earth's system. Three generations later, the Remnants have internalized this dehumanization, but now it serves a survival function rather than a punitive one. What was once oppression has become pragmatism.

### Honoring the Dead

Interestingly, the dead receive more recognition than the living. A fallen Remnant is designated **K.I.A.** (Killed In Action) — military terminology that survived from Earth, suggesting some cultural continuity despite the harsh conditions.

This creates a peculiar dynamic: living operatives are anonymous numbers, but the dead are honored with formal military designation. This may reflect survivor psychology — maintaining emotional distance from those who might die tomorrow, while respecting those who already have.

### House Names

Houses themselves often have names, though these aren't standardized across the Remnant population. Some Houses retain family surnames from Earth (the Chens, the Nguyens, the Garcias). Others have adopted descriptive names based on their territory or tactics (Ridgerunners, Ashwalkers, Thornkeepers). Still others use entirely new conventions developed over three generations.

A House name represents the permanent entity — the lineage that persists across generations and individual deaths. It's what matters. The individual Remnants who carry out the work are temporary instruments of the House's will.

### Location Naming

The Remnants use a grid system for navigation: **Zone [number], Sector [number]-[letter]**. For example: "Zone 1, Sector 4-D" or "Zone 2, Sector 7-A."

**Zones** are concentric areas radiating outward from the crash site. Zone 1 is the relatively explored frontier nearest to Remnant settlements. Zone 2 and beyond are progressively more dangerous and less understood.

**Sectors** are grid coordinates within each zone, using a number-letter format that suggests formal surveying efforts.

This standardized system implies:
- Houses cooperate on mapping (at least enough to use a shared coordinate system)
- Some level of organization persists despite the harsh conditions
- The Remnants retain scientific/military methodology from Earth
- Enough stability exists to maintain records and pass knowledge between generations

Not all Houses use this system religiously, and some remote groups have their own local naming conventions. But among the more organized settlements near the crash site, the Zone/Sector grid is standard.

## Death and Recovery

When a Remnant dies in the field, their body and equipment don't simply vanish. The House will attempt to recover what remains — if there's anything left to recover.

### The Recovery Window

Native fauna are opportunistic scavengers. Within minutes of a death, creatures begin investigating the remains. Within hours, the body is stripped of useful biomatter. The planet's aggressive biochemistry does the rest — organic compounds break down rapidly, metals corrode, and within a standard day cycle, there's often nothing left but a stain on the ground and maybe a few corroded fragments.

This creates a grim calculus for the Houses: Is it worth sending another member out to recover equipment from a fresh corpse? How much time has passed? What killed them — and is it still there?

### Death Classifications

Houses categorize deaths based on what can be learned:

**Clean Death:** Quick, early in an expedition, little tactical information gained. These deaths teach the House almost nothing beyond "that area is dangerous." The loss stings but provides minimal strategic value.

**Veteran Death:** An experienced Remnant who survived many expeditions finally falls. These deaths are significant — the veteran's accumulated knowledge, their adapted biology, their hard-won understanding of the frontier all represent real loss. But if the House can study their remains, much can be learned and incorporated.

**Tactical Death:** Died accomplishing an objective or gathering crucial intelligence. The House gains strategic knowledge even if the individual is lost.

### Recovery Protocol

Standard House procedure after a member's death:
1. Mark the location and time of death
2. Calculate degradation window based on distance and threat assessment
3. Decide: immediate recovery attempt or write it off
4. If recovering: send equipped member, move fast, expect danger
5. Salvage what remains before fauna or flora claim it completely

Some Houses have specialized "recovery operatives" — members who excel at quick, surgical recovery missions. Others write off all deaths as total losses and focus on forward progress. There's no single right answer; different Houses adapt different strategies based on their circumstances and philosophy.

### The Degradation Curve

Field observations suggest a predictable pattern:
- **0-5 minutes:** Body largely intact, equipment recoverable at 70-90%
- **5-15 minutes:** Scavengers have stripped soft tissue, equipment at 40-70%
- **15-30 minutes:** Structural integrity failing, equipment at 10-40%
- **30+ minutes:** Mostly skeletal remains, equipment heavily corroded, <10% recoverable
- **60+ minutes:** Often nothing useful left

These timeframes vary based on:
- Proximity to active fauna populations
- Local flora concentrations (some plants aggressively break down foreign organic matter)
- Environmental factors (humidity, temperature, soil composition)
- Equipment quality (some materials resist degradation better)

The five-minute "golden window" is optimistic for most recovery scenarios, but Houses that respond immediately can salvage significant resources. Wait too long, and you're sending someone into danger for scraps — or worse, for nothing.

---

## The Planet

The Remnants don't have an official name for their world. Different Houses call it different things. Most just call it "the world" or "here" — the only planet most of them have ever known.

### Environment

The planet is geologically active and ecologically young — or rather, ecologically *volatile*. Evolution here moves fast by Earth standards. Species rise and fall within decades. Ecosystems shift. What was safe territory last generation may not be safe now.

The terrain near the crash site consists of:
- **Open ground** — low alien vegetation, dark soil, breathable but thin air. The most traversable terrain.
- **Rocky formations** — pushed up by geological activity. Dense, impassable. Often hiding cave systems.
- **Wreckage fields** — where pieces of the colony ship came to rest. Three generations of scavenging haven't emptied them. The metal is slowly being absorbed by the ecosystem.
- **Flora zones** — dense patches of alien plant life, some of which blur the line between plant and animal. Bioluminescent. Reactive. Sometimes dangerous.
- **Scorched ground** — dead zones around major wreckage sites where the crash impact and subsequent fires killed everything. Slowly being reclaimed by native life.

### Evolutionary Flux

The planet's biology is not stable. Species are actively evolving, competing, and adapting on timescales visible within a human lifetime. This means:
- Creature behaviors can shift between generations
- New species appear; old ones vanish
- The ecosystem "learns" about the human presence and responds
- Mutations in native life are common and sometimes dramatic

This instability is both the planet's greatest danger and its greatest resource. A world in flux produces novel biology — compounds, materials, and organisms that don't exist anywhere else.

### Scavenging and Decomposition

The planet's ecosystem processes foreign matter aggressively. Native fauna and flora have evolved rapid decomposition mechanisms — likely an adaptation to the world's evolutionary volatility. When something dies, it doesn't stay intact for long.

This creates significant challenges for the Remnants. Food stores rot quickly unless specially preserved. Bodies break down within hours. Even metal equipment shows unusual corrosion patterns when exposed to the environment for extended periods.

Some Houses have theorized that the planet's biochemistry actively "learns" to process new materials. The first generation of Remnants reported slower decomposition rates. By the third generation, bodies left in the field are stripped within a day cycle. Whether this represents evolved adaptation by native organisms or some other mechanism remains unclear.

This rapid decomposition cycle affects House strategy:
- Bodies must be recovered quickly or not at all
- Equipment caches cannot be left unattended for long
- Permanent structures require constant maintenance
- Food preservation is a constant challenge

The flip side: the planet efficiently recycles resources. Nothing goes to waste. Everything that dies feeds something else. The Remnants exist within this cycle now, whether they like it or not.

## Creature Ecology

The planet's fauna doesn't operate on a simple hostile/friendly binary. Creatures exist on a spectrum of temperament, shaped by their ecological niche.

### Known Species (Zone 1 — Near Crash Site)

**Stalkers**
- Temperament: Aggressive
- Appearance: Dark-bodied, red-eyed. Fast-moving.
- Behavior: Apex predator of the near-crash ecosystem. Hunts anything it detects, including Remnants. Relentless once it has a target.
- Biology: Hard chitin exoskeleton, mandible-like appendages. Evolved to pursue prey over distance rather than ambush.
- Drops: Chitin Shards (exoskeleton fragments, useful as material), Biosamples (tissue for study)
- House knowledge: Well-documented. Avoid or kill. No middle ground.

**Thornbacks**
- Temperament: Territorial
- Appearance: Larger than Stalkers, green-brown coloring, orange eyes. Slower but heavily built.
- Behavior: Claims and defends a territory. Ignores anything that doesn't enter its space or threaten it. Once provoked, fights with devastating force and doesn't disengage easily.
- Biology: Dense armor plating, possibly metallic elements incorporated from scavenging wreckage debris. Hits harder than anything else in Zone 1.
- Drops: Alloy Plates (armor fragments with unusual material properties), Chitin Shards
- House knowledge: Respected. Experienced Remnants know to give them space — or to come prepared for a fight if they're guarding something valuable.

**Glimmers**
- Temperament: Skittish
- Appearance: Small, translucent-bodied, green-eyed. Bioluminescent — emits a soft, pulsing glow.
- Behavior: Flees from anything that approaches. Harmless. Extremely fast. Found near flora zones.
- Biology: Bioluminescent organs that may serve as communication or navigation. Possible symbiotic relationship with Xenoflora. Their glands contain concentrated light-producing compounds.
- Drops: Biolumen Glands (valuable organic light source), Xenoflora samples
- House knowledge: Prized for their glands. Catching one is a test of speed and patience. Some Houses consider killing them wasteful; others see them as easy resources.

### Undiscovered Species

Zone 1 represents the most explored and understood area near the crash site. Deeper zones contain species the Houses have only rumors about. Evolution doesn't stop at the borders of known territory.

---

## Xenoflora

The planet's plant life — if "plant" is even the right word — is as alien and reactive as its fauna. Xenoflora blurs the line between botanical and biological. Many species respond to proximity, contact, or damage in ways that Earth plants do not.

### Known Species (Zone 1)

**Sporepods**
- Appearance: Pulsing organic sacs, purple-pink coloration with visible internal veining
- Behavior: Inert until a creature enters proximity range, then burst and release a cloud of spores
- Effects: Variable by individual pod. Known effects include:
  - *Heal spores* — accelerate tissue repair on contact. Mechanism unknown. (~15 HP restoration)
  - *Toxic spores* — cause systemic irritation and cellular damage on inhalation. Prolonged exposure is dangerous. (~3 damage per second for several seconds)
  - *Scan spores* — interact with Remnant neural tissue to temporarily enhance spatial awareness of nearby organic material. (Reveals loot on minimap)
- House knowledge: Effects are consistent per pod but vary between pods with no external indicator. Cataloguing which pods produce which effects is valuable House knowledge. Early Remnants learned the hard way to approach cautiously.
- Design principle: Knowledge reduces randomness. A new character encounters Sporepods as a gamble. A House with deep Sporepod knowledge can predict and exploit them.

**Thornvines**
- Appearance: Dense tangles of barbed organic matter, green-brown with visible spike structures
- Behavior: Passive but physically dangerous. Contact with exposed skin causes lacerations and possible toxin transfer.
- Interaction: Walking through deals minor damage. However, Thornvines can be *harvested* — attacking them breaks them apart and yields usable Xenoflora samples.
- House knowledge: "The obstacle is the resource." Experienced Remnants don't avoid Thornvines — they harvest them. Some Houses actively cultivate Thornvines as defensive barriers around settlements.

**Lumenblooms**
- Appearance: Soft, glowing flowers with six petals, teal-blue bioluminescence
- Behavior: Emit a field of bioluminescent energy that interacts with human visual processing, temporarily enhancing perception range
- Interaction: Proximity grants expanded awareness (increased fog reveal). *Attacking them destroys the effect permanently.* They do not grow back within a single expedition.
- House knowledge: "Not everything should be attacked." Lumenblooms are one of the first lessons a new Remnant learns about the value of restraint. Veteran Remnants treat them as waypoints.

### Deeper Zones

Xenoflora becomes progressively more dangerous and more valuable in deeper zones. The same species may exist in more potent variants — a Zone 3 Sporepod might attract predators instead of merely poisoning, or a deep-zone Thornvine might be mobile.

---

## Technology

Technology in Remnant society exists in three distinct layers, each with different levels of understanding and reliability.

### Earth-Tech Relics

Salvaged from the wreckage of the colony ship. Powerful but scarce and often degraded by three generations of exposure to alien conditions.

- **Salvage Cores** — reactor fragments that still hold charge. The most valuable single item a Remnant can find. Houses trade wars over them.
- **Data Shards** — encrypted memory chips from the ship's systems. Some contain navigational data, some contain genetic records, some contain AI fragments. Decrypting them is a specialized skill.
- **Medical Stimulants** — Earth-manufactured medicine. Still effective but dwindling. Remnant-made alternatives exist but are less reliable.

### Remnant Adaptations

Technology the survivors have built or modified over three generations. Understood, reproducible, but limited by available materials.

- Jury-rigged tools and weapons built from ship scrap and native materials
- Crude but functional medical equipment
- Communication systems cobbled from ship components
- Structures built from a mix of ship hull and native stone

### Alien Biology

The planet's organisms produce compounds and materials that don't exist on Earth and aren't fully understood by the Remnants.

- **Chitin Shards** — exoskeleton material from native fauna. Harder than most Earth metals in some configurations. Used for armor and tools.
- **Biolumen Glands** — organic light sources from Glimmers. Used for illumination, signaling, and possibly medicine.
- **Xenoflora compounds** — the chemicals produced by interactive plants. Some heal, some harm, some have effects the Remnants haven't fully catalogued.
- **Alloy Plates** — from Thornbacks. Contain metallic elements the creatures may have incorporated from scavenging wreckage. A biological/technological hybrid material.

### The Ship's AI

The colony ship carried AI systems for navigation, life support, and colony management. Three generations without oversight, exposed to alien data and degraded hardware, these systems have... changed. No one knows exactly what they've become. Some Houses report finding active terminals in deep wreckage that respond to interaction. What they're thinking — if "thinking" is the right word — is an open question.

---

## The Mutation System

When a Remnant character survives a near-death experience, the planet changes them. This isn't metaphorical — the alien biochemistry that permeates the air, water, and soil actively interacts with human biology under stress.

### How It Works

- Trauma triggers accelerated adaptation. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but it appears related to the same biological processes that drove the planet's rapid evolution.
- Early in a House's history, mutations appear random. A near-death from a Stalker attack might result in enhanced hearing, or thicker skin, or light sensitivity — seemingly unconnected to the event.
- As the House catalogues more about the planet's biology, patterns emerge. Stalker venom targets the nervous system, so Stalker-related mutations tend toward sensory adaptations. Toxic spore exposure affects the respiratory system. Thornvine lacerations interact with the dermal layer.
- **Knowledge reduces randomness, but never eliminates it.** Even a House with deep understanding of Stalker biology will occasionally see a completely unexpected mutation. The planet is in evolutionary flux. Even the Houses don't know everything.

### The Cost

Mutations are never free:
- Gained dark vision might cost color perception
- Enhanced reflexes might come with chronic tremors
- Increased stamina might reduce fine motor control
- A new sensory ability might cause overload in certain environments

These tradeoffs create the character lifecycle — each near-death makes a character more adapted but more damaged. Eventually they become too specialized or too worn to continue. The player chooses: one more run, or retire to pass their knowledge to the House.

---

## The Zones

The world around the crash site is organized into zones of increasing danger, measured by distance from the relative safety of Remnant settlements.

### Zone 1 — The Frontier (Implemented)

The nearest explorable territory. Three generations of Remnant activity have made this area the most understood, but far from safe.

- **Danger level:** Introductory. Creatures are individually manageable. Flora effects are survivable.
- **Resources:** Common salvage. Some Earth-tech fragments. Abundant Xenoflora.
- **Purpose:** Where new Remnants learn the world's rules. Where Houses send characters to build experience before pushing deeper.
- **Design intent:** The tutorial that doesn't feel like a tutorial. Every system is present, every lesson is fair, and the stakes are real but forgiving.

### Zone 2+ — Deeper Territories (Planned)

Beyond the frontier, the world gets worse. And better.

- **Danger scales with distance from extraction.** The further out you go, the more dangerous the creatures, the more volatile the flora, the more valuable the salvage — and the longer you have to survive to get home.
- **New creature variants** emerge in deeper zones. Stalkers are faster. Thornbacks are harder. New species appear that don't exist near the crash site.
- **Xenoflora effects intensify.** Heal Sporepods are more potent. Toxic Sporepods can kill. Some flora has effects that don't exist in Zone 1.
- **Earth-tech relics are better preserved** — further from the crash impact zone, ship components are less damaged. But they're also deeper in alien territory.

## Open Lore Questions

These are established as "unknown" within the fiction — things the Remnants themselves don't know yet, and that we'll develop as the game expands:

- **What came before?** Ancient ruins suggest the planet had a previous intelligent species. What happened to them? Are they truly gone?
- **What are the ship's AI systems becoming?** Three generations of autonomous operation in an alien environment. Are they still serving their original purpose?
- **Is the planet aware?** The speed of evolutionary adaptation, the way organisms respond to the human presence — is there a larger intelligence at work, or is it just biology?
- **Are there other survivors?** Other ships from Project Exodus. Did any land on this world? On nearby worlds? Is anyone else out there?
- **What's in the deep zones?** The Remnants have mapped maybe 10% of the planet's surface. What's beyond the edges of their knowledge?
